title: A Shiny New Year...
---

Part of my research work at PSU entails looking at ACS/Census/LODES/LEHD data to suss out broader trends that will change the way we plan our urban growth and shape our policies.

Alright, a lot of my work is doing that, actually. And so, eventually I got to the point where I wanted to have a tool to get a quick snapshot of some essential data points from an area, with a degree of interactivity that allows for unusual geography selection. Anyone who's known me for the last few years knows I've been on a serious R kick, and so they won't be surprised to hear that the solution I came up with is centered around R and Shiny!
