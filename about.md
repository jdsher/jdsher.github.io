Some information about you!

### More Information

Childhood in Eugene, Oregon; adulthood in Portland and Seattle. I'm passionate about public transportation, GIS, and systems analysis. Side interests include: cooking, film, history, Blazers, and being in or near any body of water. 

Currently at Portland State University for a Master's of Urban & Regional Planning, my previous work in the field has taken me from Oregon Metro, to City of Redmond, to King County Metro. Always ready to take on a new R package, and constantly on the hunt for new ways of visualizing patterns and anomalies behind data.
